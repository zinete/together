        'Long kiln is a kiln that uses traditional techniques to make Longquan celadon. From the Three Kingdoms period and Jin Dynasties to the end of the Qing Dynasty, the kiln fire lasted for more than 1,700 years. The Longquan celadon was as bright as a mirror, with a sound like a chime, and a glaze like jade. Baoxi town in Longquan has the largest group of ancient Long kilns at home and abroad. These Long kilns are built on mountains, and the cave dwellings go up layer by layer, which are very spectacular.  ',
        'The traditional firing technique of Longquan celadon is based on the porcelain clay, purple gold clay, limestone and quartz  found in the Longquan area as raw materials, with hand-drawn forming technology and family-herited batching method, firing celadon at high temperature (about 1200℃-1300℃) in a kiln . Under different fire temperatures, it changes into pink green, plum green, gray green, beige and other colors. In ancient times, when a treasured porcelain came out of the kiln, it was no less than a grand carnival. ',
